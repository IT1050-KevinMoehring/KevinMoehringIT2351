# Executive Summary
Lab 2 consisted of deepening the concepts of working with basic functions and data types within SQL as well as an introduction to using independent subqueries as a search condition.

# Lab2Part1
Previous knowledge of Microsoft Excel proved helpful to work this problem out. The core of the question had to do with the sum() nested within the round() function. Fortunately I know this is formatted almost identically to that of Excel. This question was handled quickly and without much hesitation.

# Lab2Part2
This question felt mostly reminiscent of a lab 1 review on inner joins, while taking it 1 step further in using the MAX() function as well. This was simple enough to work through: identify the common keys in both joining tables, ensure syntax is correct and that all rows are pulling correctly.

# Lab2Part3
Previous knowledge of Microsoft Excel again proved helpful to work this question out. First I had to handle the JOIN and ensure that it was formatted correctly. Then I moved on to the arithmentic portion of the question. These type of questions are similar to those I handle at work on a daily basis, and is formatted almost identically in Excel so this portion took little time to work out.

# Lab2Part4
This was my first experience performing a JOIN on more than 2 tables at a time which proved simpler than expected, but took me awhile to figure out through a bit of trial and error. I still do not have a full understanding of how WITH ROLLUP affects a query, which will need follow-up soon.

# Lab2Part5
Again, a strong background in Microsoft Excel proved helpful in using an independent subquery as a search condition in this query. I began by writing the subquery first, then building around it. This tactic will not always work, as dependent subqueries also exist, but I was able to identify this was not one of those cases.

# Lab2Part6
This question served as a syntax check for FORMAT(), CONVERT(), and CAST(). Dealing with data types is new for me considering my Excel based background - where data types are at most an afterthought. However, this question simply required a double-check for formatting in the book and was easily dealt with.

# Lab2Part7
This portion of the lab was likely the hardest for most people, but once again, experience with Excel helped me piece the correct answer together. I had to determine the # of characters from the start as well and from the end of each string up until the "@". To do this, I used Left(Locate()) for the user_name and Right(Lenth() - Locate()) for the domain_name.

# Conclusion
This lab proved an old adage that once you know a single programming language, others are much easier to learn. The experience I have in Microsoft Excel proved to be invaluable in the completeion of this lab. I will, however, need to review the WITH ROLLUP in order to fully understand what impact it has on a query. This lab helped me learn to manipulate data types and gave an introduction to independent subqueries that I am sure will be integral as the course continues.
