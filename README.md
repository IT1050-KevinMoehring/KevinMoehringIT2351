# Creating a Database from a Script
After hours failing to connect to the MySQL80 server, using the VM proved to be fruitful. I saved the northwind database, opened MySQL Workbench, ctrl+Shft+O and opened the Northwind database, edited the comment secion and 2 other lines accordingly, ran the code, saved the file, then uploaded a snapshot to github.

# Retrieving Data From Two or More Tables
An inner join combines multiple tables as an intersection of the tables. Any rows that would have a NULL value created from the join are omitted. A full outer join creates a union between multiple tables and keeps any/all NULL values.
